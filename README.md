# Motivation

The goal of this tutorial project was to learn how to use the [framer-motion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-motion) and [styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components) libraries along with React.js + TypeScript. I also learned how to work with localStorage.
